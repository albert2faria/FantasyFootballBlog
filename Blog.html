        <h1>Most Important Players and Positions:</h1>
        <p>Midfielders are the most important position in Fantasy league football and
           the place where you should spend your money. Example of a player:
            Aubameyang. </p>  
        <p>Defense is the place where you can save your budget, with one exception 
          Alexander-Aarnold is a must have.</p>
        <p>The Keepers are the position where you can avoid spending the big bucks,
           keep a solid and trusty goallie with a low cost. Example: Ryan or MCarthy.</p>
        <p>Forwards are key in Fantasy Football, spend some money in a power forward and then 
           just use budget picks to fill the rest of them. Example: Sergio Aguero.</p>
